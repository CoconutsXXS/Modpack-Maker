# Modpack Maker
"Modpack Maker" is a provisory name for a quite big project: the ultimate modpack creation app. Providing the best way to discover new community content and to debug/optimize modpacks while keeping them organized with a folder system to have more efficient control over big modpacks.

## Features List
- **Multi-platform mod/rp/shader browser** including Modrinth, CurseForge, Planet Minecraft, minecraftmods.com, Minecraft Shader and more in the future. (*In progress for now*)
- **Multi-loader support** including Forge (with Sinytra Connector), Fabric, NeoForge, Quilt. (*In progress for now*)
- **Folder system** to separate all your hundreds of mods/rp/shaders into categories you want (optimization, graphics, structures, sounds, QoL, etc...). You can also disable/enable mods for fast debugging. (*Finished*)
- **Content preview**, this app is about discoveries and speed. You can directly see mod/rp/... info by hovering their icon while exploring platforms. You can instantly **test** mods in one click via their page. (*Finished*)
- **Integrated websites**, community content platforms like CurseForge and Modrinth websites are directly in the app and modified to be directly downloaded into your modpack. (*Finished*)
- **Ultra-easy mod discovery**, the Modpack Maker provides a Minecraft YouTube showcase/top videos browser and displays info, gallery, and download button in real time as the video showcases the mod. (*Finished*)
- **Mod configuration in-app**, tired of manually opening a .json/.xml/... file to modify your mod options? Modify config directly in the app. (*In progress for now*)
- **See which mod causes lag**, display server/client/rendering process statistics to see in detail which mod is causing lag. (*Planned*)
- **See mod/rp added content**, explore all the elements a mod adds and modify their appearance to match your modpack style. (*Planned*)
- **Understand crashes** with a color-coded console that shows which mod logged what and highlights where a mod ID is mentioned. (*Planned*)
- **Preset/wishlist**, quickly import little lists of mods that you usually use like an optimization/structure/other themed selection of mods. Add interesting mods you discover into your wishlist to add them to modpacks later. (*Planned*)
- **Linux/Mac/Windows** compatibility. (*Tested on macOS for now*)
